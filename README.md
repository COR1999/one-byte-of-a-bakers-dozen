    1. MongoDB was used to store all my recipes and users information.
5. []()
7. [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

9. [Font-awesome Version 5.11.1](https://fontawesome.com/) 
    1. Font-awesome was used to get some icons.


## Testing
1. I used Chrome Dev Tools for debug Testing.
    1. I used the inspect feature to check different elements on my page.
    2. I used the coverage tab to check my css was being used on the given page.
    3. I used the network tab to see what was taking a long time to load and what wasn't loading.
    4. I used the computed tab to see the final state of a given element.
    5. I used the device toolbar to check that my website was rendered in a responsive manner on all device's.
    6. I installed the chrome [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) plugin to use the audit feature to check Performance, progressive web app, Best practices, accessibility and SEO.
2. Application Testing
    1. I tested that everything worked okay when resizing the browser.
    2. I ran all my tests on localhost (root website) then pushed it onto github (where ran off the subdomain). Checked that all resources loaded properly off the root and subdomain.
    3. I checked on mobile to see that everything was working correctly.
    


## Deployment
I used [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) on my windows PC and once I was happy I committed to github to check that everything ran smoothly there as well.
